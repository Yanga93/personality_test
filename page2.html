        <h2>Your Personality Type is - <br> Logician:</h2>
        <img src="img/albert_einstein.png" class="logicianImg" />
        <p>Innovative investors with an unquechable thirst for knowledge.<br></p>
        <p1> The Logician personality type is fairly rare, making up only three percent of the population, which is definitely a good thing for them, as there’s nothing they’d be more unhappy about than being “common”. Logicians pride themselves on their inventiveness
          and creativity, their unique perspective and vigorous intellect. Usually known as the philosopher, the architect, or the dreamy professor, Logicians have been responsible for many scientific discoveries throughout history.</p1>
      </div>
      <div class="personality Architect hide ">
        <h2>Your Personality Type is - <br> Architect:</h2>
        <img src="img/Architect.png" class="architectImg" />
        <p>Imaginative and strategic thinkers, with a plan for everything.<br></p>
        <p2>It’s lonely at the top, and being one of the rarest and most strategically capable personality types, Architects know this all too well. Architects form just two percent of the population, and women of this personality type are especially rare,
          forming just 0.8% of the population – it is often a challenge for them to find like-minded individuals who are able to keep up with their relentless intellectualism and chess-like maneuvering. People with the Architect personality type are imaginative
          yet decisive, ambitious yet private, amazingly curious, but they do not squander their energy.
        </p2>

      <div class="personality Commander hide ">
        <h2>Your Personality Type is - <br> Commander:</h2>
        <img src="img/Commander.png" class="commanderImg" />
        <p>Bold, immaginative and strong-willed leaders, always finding way - or making one.<br></p>
        <p2>Commanders are natural-born leaders. People with this personality type embody the gifts of charisma and confidence, and project authority in a way that draws crowds together behind a common goal. However, Commanders are also characterized by an
          often ruthless level of rationality, using their drive, determination and sharp minds to achieve whatever end they’ve set for themselves. Perhaps it is best that they make up only three percent of the population, lest they overwhelm the more
          timid and sensitive personality types that make up much of the rest of the world – but we have Commanders to thank for many of the businesses and institutions we take for granted every day.

      <div class="personality Debater hide ">
        <h2>Your Personality Type is - <br> Debater:</h2>
        <img src="img/Debater.png" class="debaterImg" />
        <p>Smart and curious thinkers who cannot recist an intellectual challenge.<br></p>
        <p2>The Debater personality type is the ultimate devil’s advocate, thriving on the process of shredding arguments and beliefs and letting the ribbons drift in the wind for all to see. Debaters don’t do this because they are trying to achieve some
          deeper purpose or strategic goal, but for the simple reason that it’s fun. No one loves the process of mental sparring more than Debaters, as it gives them a chance to exercise their effortlessly quick wit, broad accumulated knowledge base,
          and capacity for connecting disparate ideas to prove their points.
        </p2>
      </div>
      <div class="personality Advocate hide ">
        <h2>Your Personality Type is - <br> Advocate:</h2>
        <img src="img/nelson_mandela.png" class="advocateImg" />
        <p>Quiet and mystical, yet very inspiring and tireless idealists.<br></p>
        <p2>The Advocate personality type is very rare, making up less than one percent of the population, but they nonetheless leave their mark on the world. As members of the Diplomat Role group, Advocates have an inborn sense of idealism and morality,
          but what sets them apart is that they are not idle dreamers, but people capable of taking concrete steps to realize their goals and make a lasting positive impact.
        </p2>

      <div class="personality Mediator hide ">
        <h2>Your Personality Type is - <br> Mediator:</h2>
        <img src="img/Mediator.png" class="mediatorImg" />
        <p>Poetic, kind and altruistic people, always eager to help a good cause.<br></p>
        <p2>Mediator personalities are true idealists, always looking for the hint of good in even the worst of people and events, searching for ways to make things better. While they may be perceived as calm, reserved, or even shy, Mediators have an inner
          flame and passion that can truly shine. Comprising just 4% of the population, the risk of feeling misunderstood is unfortunately high for the Mediator personality type – but when they find like-minded people to spend their time with, the harmony
          they feel will be a fountain of joy and inspiration.</p2>
      </div>
      <div class="personality Protagonist hide ">
        <h2>Your Personality Type is - <br> Protagonist:</h2>
        <img src="img/oprah_winfrey.png" class="protagonistImg" />
        <p>Charismatic and inspiring leaders, able to mesmerize their listeners.<br></p>
        <p2>Protagonists are natural-born leaders, full of passion and charisma. Forming around two percent of the population, they are oftentimes our politicians, our coaches and our teachers, reaching out and inspiring others to achieve and to do good in
          the world. With a natural confidence that begets influence, Protagonists take a great deal of pride and joy in guiding others to work together to improve themselves and their community.

      <div class="personality Executive hide ">
        <h2>Your Personality Type is - <br> Executive:</h2>
        <img src="img/Executive.png" class="executiveImg" />
        <p>Excellent administrators, unsurpassed at managing things - or people.<br></p>
        <p2>Executives are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding of what is right, wrong and socially acceptable to bring families and communities together. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with
          the Executive personality type are valued for their clear advice and guidance, and they happily lead the way on difficult paths. Taking pride in bringing people together, Executives often take on roles as community organizers, working hard to
          bring everyone together in celebration of cherished local events, or in defense of the traditional values that hold families and communities together.</p2>
